/* file sig_ex3.c: This is a more complex example of signals
   Author: Ramesh Yerraballi
   Attempt to mimic:
     prompt>> top | grep firefox 
   The parent creates  a pipe and two child processes with the
   write end of the pipe serving as the stdout for top and
   the read end serving as the stdin for grep.
   The first child that exec's top creates a new session with itself a member leader
   of the process group in it. The process group's id is same as the child's pid (pid_ch1).
   The second child that exec's grep joins the process group that the first child created
   Now when a Ctr-c is pressed the parent relays a SIGINT to both children using 
      kill(-pid_ch1,SIGINT); alternative you could call killpg(pid_ch1,SIGINT); 
   The two child processes receive the SIGINT and their default behavior is to terminate.
   Once they do that the parent reaps their exit status (using wait), prints and exits.
   When a  Ctrl-z is pressed the the parent relays a SIGTSTP to both children using 
      kill(-pid_ch1,SIGTSTP);
   The parent's waitpid() call unblocks when the child receives the STOP signal. The parent
   waits for 4 secs and resumes the the child that STOPped. This happens once for each of 
   the two children.
